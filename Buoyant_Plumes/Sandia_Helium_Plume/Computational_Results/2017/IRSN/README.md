### Computational Cost (hh:mm:ss)
Wall clock time: 48:12:13 h:m:s 

Simulation time: 10s

Number of CPUs (MPI Processes): 200

CPU cost (Number of CPUs * Wall clock time / Simulation time / Total cells): 0.16677

------------------

### Averaging period

3 s of physical time

------------------

### Special issues/problems

In spite of a refined mesh, the top velocity, resolved turbulent kinetic energy, Helium mass fraction and its variance are overestimated.
Conjointly, the puffing frequency is not clearly resolved, even if puffing structures can be observed on the helium mass fraction field and
temporal one-point recordings.
